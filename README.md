# Subnational Migration Analysis
This repository provides the computational framework and analytical pipeline for modeling subnational migration flows. 
By treating arrivals and exits as independent Poisson processes, we utilize the Skellam Distribution to analyze net migration dynamics across various demographic and spatial dimensions.

This repository is the codebase for the paper:
